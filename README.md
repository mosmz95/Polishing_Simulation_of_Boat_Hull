## Instruction

### ROS Installation on Ubuntu

 

1. Configure the Ubuntu repositories to allow "restricted," "universe," and "multiverse" repositories:  

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository universe
sudo add-apt-repository multiverse
sudo apt update
```
2. Setup your sources.list:  

Setup your computer to accept software from packages.ros.org.
```bash
  sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
```
3. Set up your keys:  

```bash
  sudo apt install curl # if you haven't already installed curl
  curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.asc | sudo apt-key add -
  ```
4. Update Debian packages:  

```bash
  sudo apt update
```
6. Install the full desktop version of ROS Noetic:  

```bash
  sudo apt install ros-noetic-desktop-full
```
7. Install the MOVEIT package, which is required for the trajectory planning of the robot.

```bash
  sudo apt install ros-noetic-moveit
```
8. Environment setup
```bash
  echo "source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
  source ~/.bashrc
```
9. Dependencies for building packages:
To install this tool and other dependencies for building ROS packages, run:  

```bash
  sudo apt install python3-rosdep python3-rosinstall python3-rosinstall-generator python3-wstool build-essential
```
9.1. Initialize rosdep:   

```bash
  sudo apt install python3-rosdep
```      
now initialize rosdep:  

```bash
  sudo rosdep init rosdep update
```
### Building the workspace:
1. Create a directory for the workspace:

```bash
  mkdir -p robotslider_ws/src
```
2. Go to the source directory of the workspace and clone the repository

```bash
cd robotslider_ws/src   
git clone https://github.com/mosmz95/Polishing_Simulation_of_Boat_Hull.git
```
3. Build the workspace:

```bash 
  cd robotslider_ws
  catkin build
```
4. source the created workspace in the .bashrc file:

```bash
  echo "source robotslider_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
  source ~/.bashrc
```

otherwise, it is required to source the workspace whenever a new terminal is open.



## Procedure to launch the Simulation environments

##### Visualization:  
The robot-slider movement is visualized in Rviz where by changing the slide-bar for each joint, you can see the range of motion of the corresponding joint.
```bash
  roslaunch robot_slider_description rviz_launch.launch 
```

##### Simulation of robot-slider motion: 

Gazebo software is a physics engine in which according to physical properties -like mass,intertia,etc, defined in urdf file- the dynamics of robot-slider movement is simulated. In fact, gazebo is a substitution of actual robot-slider. 

1. To launch the gazebo, run the following line in a new terminal:

```bash
  roslaunch robot_slider_bringup gazebo_launch.launch gui:=true
```
  In case you don't want to see grafical user interface, rewrite ``` gui:=false```

2. Launch the controller:

```bash
  roslaunch robot_slider_controller controller.launch
```

3. Launch the move_group which does the joint trajectory planning:  

```bash 
  roslaunch robot_slider_moveit move_group.launch
```

4. To do trajectory plainning graphically, launch Rviz:

```bash 
  roslaunch robot_slider_description rviz_trajectoryplanning_launch.launch
```

5. if the desired joint positions are known in advance, you can edit the python file  ```robotslider_command.py``` inside the  robot_slider_controller package, then execute it:
```bash
  rosrun robot_slider_controller robotslider_command.py
```
